TODO:

* check to see if plot_chromosome and shown stimuli match. (at least
  it seems upside down)

* last response in minimize_stimulus is always zero. repair

* the continue option in waiting for the extraction causes the program
  to crash. repair.

* figure out why it worked so badly for the cortex

* better way to store all populations and generations, to later see
  what happened



*: important
